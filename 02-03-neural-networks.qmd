## Introduction

Individual neurons are the building blocks, but the real computational power of the nervous system emerges from networks. In this section, we'll explore how to connect neurons through synapses and simulate network dynamics using Neun.

Understanding networks requires grasping three key concepts:

1. **Synapses**: The connections between neurons that enable communication
2. **Connectivity**: The pattern of which neurons connect to which (the connectome)
3. **Network dynamics**: The collective behavior that emerges from neuronal interactions

## Types of Synapses

Neun provides two main types of synaptic connections, each with distinct properties and biological relevance:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Electrical Synapses

Electrical synapses (gap junctions) provide **direct electrical coupling** between neurons through protein channels that connect their cytoplasm. 

The current through a gap junction is proportional to the voltage difference:
$$I_{syn} = g_{gap} \cdot (V_1 - V_2)$$

where $g_{gap}$ is the gap junction conductance (typically 0.001-0.01).

This creates:

- **Instantaneous transmission**: No synaptic delay
- **Bidirectional communication**: Current flows both ways
- **Synchronization**: Tendency to align neuron activity

**Structure**: `ESynN1N2PrecisionIntegrator`

```{.python filename="src/electrical-synapse.py"}
{{< include src/electrical-synapse.py >}}
```

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Hands-on

Try modifying the coupling conductance... Are you able to change the synchronization level? 💻


<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
- Change `0.002` to `0.001` (weaker coupling)
- Change to `0.003` (stronger coupling)

You can tell the strength of the coupling from the distance between peaks.

### Diffusion Synapses

Diffusion synapses model **chemical-like coupling** with time-dependent dynamics that approximate neurotransmitter diffusion across the synaptic cleft:

- **Slower transmission**: Time-dependent dynamics
- **Filtering effects**: Can smooth rapid fluctuations  
- **Biological realism**: Better models chemical synapses

**Structure**: `DSynN1N2PrecisionIntegrator`

```{.python filename="src/diffusion-synapse.py"}
{{< include src/diffusion-synapse.py >}}
```
<!-- 
::: {.callout-note}
## Diffusion vs Electrical

While diffusion synapses include dynamics, they're still simplified compared to full chemical synapses. For more realistic chemical transmission (with neurotransmitter release, receptors, etc.), you'd need additional mechanisms.
::: -->

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Hands-on

Compare the two synapse types... 💻

Run both examples and observe:
- Which shows faster coupling?
- Which produces tighter synchronization?
- How do the voltage traces differ?

::: {.callout-important}
## Remember: Synapse Naming Convention

Neun follows a systematic naming pattern for synapses:

```
{SynapseType}{Neuron1Type}{Neuron2Type}{Precision}{Integrator}
```

**Examples**:
- `ESynHHHHDoubleRK4` - Electrical synapse between two HH neurons
- `DSynHRHRDoubleRK6` - Diffusion synapse between two HR neurons  
- `ESynHHHRFloatRK4` - Electrical synapse from HH to HR neuron

**Important**: [Always step synapses **before** stepping neurons](step-order.qmd) in your simulation loop!

## Building Neural Networks

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Feedforward Network

Let's build a simple feedforward chain where activity propagates from one neuron to the next:

```{.python filename="src/feedforward.py"}
{{< include src/feedforward.py >}}
```

**Observation**: Notice how the spike travels through the chain with some delay. The coupling strength determines how effectively the signal propagates.

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Hands-on

Experiment with the chain... 💻

1. Change the coupling strength (currently `-0.002`)
2. Add input to the last neuron instead of the first
3. Add more neurons to the chain (change `4` to `6` or `8`)

What's the maximum chain length before signal dies out?
:::

### Raster Plots

Raster plots show **spike times** for all neurons, revealing temporal patterns:

```{.python filename="src/raster-plot.py"}
{{< include src/raster-plot.py >}}
```

**What to look for**:
- **Synchrony**: Vertical alignment of spikes
- **Propagation**: Diagonal patterns
- **Rhythms**: Regular spacing

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Hands-on

Analyze the raster plot... 💻

- Can you identify synchronized events?
- Do you see traveling waves?
- Try increasing the coupling strength - what changes?
:::

## Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)

CPGs are neural circuits that produce **rhythmic patterns** without rhythmic input. They're essential for locomotion, breathing, and other rhythmic behaviors.

Key features of CPGs:

- **Intrinsic rhythmicity**: Generated by network dynamics, not input
- **Phase relationships**: Neurons fire in specific temporal order
- **Robustness**: Maintain rhythm despite perturbations

### Reciprocal Inhibition Model

A classic CPG uses two neurons with mutual inhibition creating alternating bursts:

```{.python filename="src/cpg-analysis.py"}
{{< include src/cpg-analysis.py >}}
```

::: {.callout-note}
## CPG Analysis Metrics

**Inter-Burst Interval (IBI)**: Time between successive bursts in one neuron
- Measures rhythm regularity
- CV of IBI < 0.1 indicates regular rhythm

**Burst duration**: Time from first to last spike in a burst
- Measures rhythm regularity
- Characterizes a phase in the cycle
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
#### Hands-on

Modify the CPG... 💻

1. Change coupling strength (`-0.05` → `-0.03` or `-0.08`)
2. Try asymmetric coupling (different values for each direction)
3. Adjust external drive `I` parameter

Can you create a different phase relationship?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Stronger coupling → faster synchronization  
Asymmetric coupling → asymmetric phase relationship  
Higher drive → faster rhythm

## Excitation-Inhibition Balance

Real neural networks contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The balance between them is critical for stable dynamics.

::: {.callout-note}
## E-I Balance Principles

- **Too much excitation**: Runaway activity, seizures
- **Too much inhibition**: Network shuts down, no response  
- **Balanced**: Stable, responsive, rich dynamics

Typical cortical networks: ~80% excitatory, ~20% inhibitory neurons

Current Neun implementation focuses on electrical and diffusion coupling. For explicit excitatory/inhibitory synapses, you can:
1. Use coupling conductance sign and magnitude
2. Implement through the external input mechanism
3. Wait for future Neun updates with chemical synapse models!

## Best Practices for Network Simulations

::: {.callout-important}
## Simulation Tips

**1. Update Order Matters**
```python
# Correct order:
for synapse in synapses:
    synapse.step(step)
    
for neuron in neurons:
    neuron.step(step)
```

**2. Pre-allocate Storage**
```python
# Efficient for large networks
n_steps = int(duration / step)
voltages = np.zeros((n_neurons, n_steps))
```

**3. Choose Appropriate Time Steps**
- Too large: Numerical instability
- Too small: Slow simulation
- Typical: 0.001-0.01 ms for HH neurons

**4. Monitor for Pathological States**
- Check for NaN or infinite values
- Watch for runaway excitation
- Validate with known behaviors
:::

**Key takeaways**:

- Synapses create the connectivity that enables network computation
- Small changes in coupling can dramatically alter network behavior
- Appropriate visualization reveals patterns invisible in raw data
- CPGs demonstrate how networks generate complex behaviors autonomously

## Exercises

Test your understanding with these challenges:

1. **Bidirectional vs Unidirectional**: Create a synapse with asymmetric coupling (different conductances in each direction). How does this affect synchronization?

2. **Network motifs**: Build a 3-neuron network with a "feedback loop" (1→2→3→1). Compare its dynamics to a simple chain.

3. **Heterogeneous network**: Create a network mixing HH and HR neurons. Use `ESynHHHRDoubleRK4` for cross-type connections.

4. **Phase analysis**: For the CPG, compute the phase difference as a percentage of the cycle period. Is it stable at 50%?

5. **Critical coupling**: Find the minimum coupling strength needed for a chain of 5 neurons to propagate a signal from first to last.

6. **Oscillation frequency**: Modify CPG parameters to generate faster rhythms. Can you reach 10 Hz? 50 Hz?

<details>
<summary>Solution Hints</summary>

**Ex 1**: Use different values for the two conductance parameters:
```python
synapse = neun_py.ESynHHHHDoubleRK4(h1, v, h2, v, -0.003, -0.001)
```

**Ex 3**: Mix neuron types by creating different neurons and using cross-type synapse classes:
```python
hh_neuron = neun_py.HHDoubleRK4(hh_args)
hr_neuron = neun_py.HRDoubleRK4(hr_args)
synapse = neun_py.ESynHHHRDoubleRK4(hh_neuron, hh_v, hr_neuron, hr_v, -g, -g)
```

**Ex 6**: Increase external drive `I` parameter in HR neurons for faster bursting.
