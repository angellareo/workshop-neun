Computational neuroscience provides a framework for understanding the brain by combining different approaches: mathematics, computer science, and theoretical analysis  allow us to understand the principles that govern the development, structure, physiology and cognitive abilities of the nervous system.

By abstracting complex neural systems into models, we can uncover principles that govern brain function, predict behavior, and guide experiments in ways that would be difficult with observation alone.

Key insights include:

- **Modeling as a tool for understanding**. Models are not just simulations; they are ways to formalize hypotheses, test ideas, and explore “what-if” scenarios in a controlled setting.  
- **Levels of abstraction matter**: Different questions require different modeling approaches, from detailed biophysical models to abstract system-level representations. Choosing the right level of detail is essential.  
- **Emergent behavior arises from interactions**: Neural networks exhibit behaviors that are not present in single neurons, highlighting the importance of connectivity, dynamics, and feedback.  
- **Combining computational models with experimental data** improve the models, and strengthens predictions.  
- **Iterative refinement drives progress**: Modeling is a cyclical process: build, simulate, analyze, compare with data, and refine. This iterative loop accelerates learning and discovery in neuroscience.
- **Tools empower exploration**: Software frameworks and simulation libraries like Neun enable rapid prototyping, reproducibility, and scalability, allowing researchers to focus on the science rather than implementation details.

Ultimately, computational models serve as a bridge between intuition and experiment, allowing us to explore the principles of neural computation, predict outcomes, and uncover mechanisms that underlie cognition and behavior. Embracing these approaches equips researchers with a versatile toolkit for both discovery and innovation in neuroscience.


## Advanced topics
There are some advanced topics that we have not covered in this workshop, but that you can explore on your own:

- **Fitting to experimental data**: Use optimization techniques to fit model parameters to real neural recordings.
- **Large-scale simulations**: Explore how to simulate larger networks efficiently using parallel computing.
- **Plasticity and learning rules**: Implement synaptic plasticity mechanisms to study how synapses adapt.

## Neun
As you now know, Neun is an open-source tool for modeling and efficient simulation.

We have seen along the workshop how to use Neun to create and simulate neurons and simple neural networks, how to analyze the results, and how to visualize the dynamics.

### Now is your turn! 🫵
Now you have the power to use Neun, so use it wisely ;)

And remember, **you can also contribute to the project via pull request** (for example, to include any improvement that you may want to use). 

If you want to include a new model or use Neun in C++ check out this example repository: github.com/GNB-UAM/Neun-Example

Contact us if you have any questions or if you want to develop something together!
