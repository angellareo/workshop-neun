## Welcome!

Welcome to this hands-on workshop on computational neuroscience using the **Neun** library. This workshop is designed to provide you with both theoretical foundations and practical skills for modeling neural systems.

During the workshop, feel free to ask questions at any time. After the workshop, you can:

- Open issues on the [workshop repository](https://github.com/angellareo/workshop-neun)
- [Contact the facilitators](mailto:angel.lareo@uam.es,alicia.garrido@uam.es?subject=[UPS2025%20Neun%20Workshop])

## About the Workshop

Computational neuroscience bridges the gap between experimental observations and theoretical understanding of neural systems. This workshop will guide you through:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding why and how we model neural systems
2. **Practical Skills**: Learning to use the Neun library for neural simulations
3. **Real Applications**: Connecting models to experimental findings

## The Neun Library

[Neun](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/Neun/) is a C++ library for simulating neuronal networks. 



## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience
Learn the fundamental principles of neural modeling, from single neurons to networks. Understand the mathematical foundations and their biological relevance.

**Duration**: ~15 min

**Topics**:

- Why model neural systems?
- Single neuron dynamics
- From neurons to networks

### Part 2: Hands-on with Neun to simulate neural dynamics
Get practical experience building and simulating neural models using the Neun library.

**Duration**: ~2 h

**Topics**:

- Installing and setting up Neun
- Creating single neuron models
- Building and simulating neural networks
- Advanced modeling techniques

### Part 3: Analyzing neural dynamics from Neun's simulations
Learn how to analyze the results obtained from simulating neural models using Neun.

**Duration**: ~45 min

**Topics**:
- Analyzing neural dynamics


## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you should have:

- **Required**: Basic Python programming skills
- **Recommended**: Familiarity with basic neuroscience concepts
- **Helpful**: Experience with NumPy and Matplotlib

## Getting Started

Before the workshop, please ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your computer
2. **Jupyter** (Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook)
3. **Dependencies** installed (see below)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the workshop repository
git clone https://github.com/angellareo/workshop-neun.git
cd workshop-neun

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing Your Setup

Run this quick test to verify your installation:

```python
import neun
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("All dependencies are installed correctly!")
print(f"Neun version: {neun.__version__}")
```
