## Welcome!

Welcome to this hands-on workshop on computational neuroscience using the **Neun** library. This workshop is designed to provide you with both theoretical foundations and practical skills for modeling neural systems.

**Facilitators**:

* Dr. Ángel Lareo

* Dr. Alicia Garrido-Peña

## About the Workshop

Computational neuroscience bridges the gap between experimental observations and theoretical understanding of neural systems. This workshop will guide you through:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding why and how to model neural systems
2. **Practical Skills**: Learning to use the Neun library for neural simulations
3. **Real Applications**: Understanding how to use the models as a complement to experimental findings

## The Neun Library

[Neun](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/Neun/) is a C++ library for simulating neuronal networks. 
You can directly work in C++ or use our [Python bindings](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/neun_py) to directly simulate your models in Python. 


## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience
Learn the fundamental principles of neural modeling, from single neurons to networks. Understand the mathematical foundations and their biological relevance.

**Duration**: ~15 min

**Topics**:

- Why model neural systems?
- Single neuron dynamics
- From neurons to networks

### Part 2: Hands-on with Neun to simulate neural dynamics
Get practical experience building and simulating neural models using the Neun library.

**Duration**: ~2 h

**Topics**:

- Installing and setting up Neun
- Creating single neuron models
- Building and simulating neural networks
- Advanced modeling techniques

### Part 3: Analyzing neural dynamics from Neun's simulations
Learn how to analyze the results obtained from simulating neural models using Neun.

**Duration**: ~45 min

**Topics**:
- Analyzing neural dynamics
