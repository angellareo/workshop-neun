## Welcome!

Welcome to this hands-on workshop on computational neuroscience using the **Neun** library. This workshop is designed to provide you with both theoretical foundations and practical skills for modeling neural systems.

**Facilitators**:

* Dr. Ángel Lareo: angel.lareo@uam.es

* Dr. Alicia Garrido-Peña: alicia.garrido@uam.es

[More info about the facilitators...](facilitators.qmd)

During the workshop, feel free to **ask questions at any time**.

After the workshop, you can:

- Open issues on the [workshop repository](https://github.com/angellareo/workshop-neun)
- [Contact the facilitators](mailto:angel.lareo@uam.es,alicia.garrido@uam.es?subject=[UPS2025%20Neun%20Workshop])

## About the Workshop

Computational neuroscience bridges the gap between experimental observations and theoretical understanding of neural systems. This workshop will guide you through:

1. **Theoretical Foundations**: Understanding why and how to model neural systems
2. **Practical Skills**: Learning to use the Neun library for neural simulations
3. **Real Applications**: Create your own models and circuits!

## The Neun Library

[Neun](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/Neun/) is a C++ library for simulating neuronal networks. 
You can directly work in C++ or use our [Python bindings](https://github.com/GNB-UAM/neun_py) to directly simulate your models in Python. 


## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to Computational Neuroscience
Learn the fundamental principles of neural modeling, from single neurons to networks. Understand the mathematical foundations and their biological relevance.

**Duration**: ~20 min

**Topics**:

- Why model neural systems?
- Single neuron dynamics
- From neurons to networks

### Part 2: Hands-on with Neun to simulate neural dynamics and networks
Get practical experience building and simulating neural models using the Neun library.

**Duration**: ~3 h

**Topics**:

- Installing and setting up Neun
- Creating single neuron models
- Building and simulating neural networks
- Advanced modeling techniques
- Analyzing the results

### Part 3: Conclusions and closing

**Duration**: ~20 min

**Topics**:
- Analyzing neural dynamics


## Prerequisites
