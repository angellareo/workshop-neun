## Why Computational Neuroscience?

The brain is one of the most complex systems in nature. Understanding how neurons communicate, process information, and generate behavior requires tools that can bridge multiple scales—from molecular mechanisms to network dynamics and cognitive functions.

### The Challenge of Complexity

Consider these facts:

- Each neuron can connect to thousands of other neurons
- Neural signals **process information** in multiple ways (rate-coding, temporal coding...) and on timescales from **milliseconds to hours**
- Brain functions emerge from the collective activity of neural populations

Computational models help us:

1. **Formalize hypotheses** about neural function
2. **Predict** neural behavior under stimulation or different conditions
3. **Check theories** that would be difficult or impossible to test experimentally
4. **Integrate** findings across different scales and modalities

<!-- @TODO: Figure? -->
That enables a cycle of: **Experimental measurement -> Model building -> Simulation -> Prediction -> Experimental validation**.

## Levels of Neural Modeling

Neural systems can be modeled at different levels of abstraction:

### 1. Biophysical Models
**Detail**: High (ion channels, membrane properties)  
**Scale**: Single neuron  
**Examples**: Hodgkin-Huxley model, multi-compartment models

These models capture detailed mechanisms but are computationally expensive.

### 2. Simplified Neuron Models
**Detail**: Medium (integrate-and-fire, adaptive threshold)  
**Scale**: Single neuron to small networks  
**Examples**:  Izhikevich model.

Balance between biological realism and computational efficiency.

### 3. Rate Models
**Detail**: Low (average firing rates)  
**Scale**: Large networks  
**Examples**: Wilson-Cowan model, neural field models

Capture population dynamics efficiently.

### 4. Abstract Models
**Detail**: Minimal (information processing)  
**Scale**: System-level  
**Examples**: Artificial neural networks, cognitive decision-making models

Focus on function rather than biological detail.

## Choosing the Right Level

The appropriate level of modeling depends on your question:

- Studying ion channel responses? → Biophysical model
- Understanding network interactions? → Simplified neuron model
- Modeling sensory processing across large populations? → Rate model
- Testing cognitive theories? → Abstract model

## Neuron Dynamics

Neurons encode information by using electrical signals. Their membrane potential changes in response to internal states and external stimuli. As a result, neurons produce action potentials (spikes).

### The Neuron as an Electrical Circuit

A neuron can be modelled as an electrical circuit with:

- **Capacitance** (C): Cell membrane stores charge
- **Resistance** (R): Ion channels control current flow
- **Current sources** (I): Synaptic inputs and intrinsic currents

<!-- @TODO: Check image added include thesis reference? -->

### Information coding in Neurons

Actions potentials are the primary means of neural communication. Neurons can encode information using a spiking signal in several ways:
- **Shape of the action potentials (spikes)**: conveys information about the state of a neuron
- **Firing rate**: Average number of spikes per unit time
- **Temporal coding**: Precise timing of action potentials

<!-- @TODO: Add here a section about a certain model? -->

But neurons do not operate in isolation.

## From Neurons to Networks: Synapses

### Why networks natter

Individual neurons are limited in their computational capabilities. Complex nervous functions emerge from **networks** of interconnected neurons. For instance, a simple learning circuit in a snail may contain around 20–50 neurons with roughly 1,000–2,000 synapses, a small cortical microcircuit in a mouse can involve 100 neurons forming 100,000–1,000,000 synapses, and human cortical circuits feature neurons with 10,000–30,000 synapses each, resulting in billions of connections. This dramatic increase in connectivity underlies the emergence of more sophisticated behaviors and cognitive functions.

### Synaptic connections

Neurons communicate through synapses:

- **Chemical synapses**: Release neurotransmitters (excitatory or inhibitory)
- **Electrical synapses**: Direct electrical coupling through gap junctions

The strength and dynamics of synaptic connections determine network behavior.

### Network Architecture

Different connection patterns lead to different dynamics:

1. **Feedforward networks**: Information flows in one direction
2. **Recurrent networks**: Neurons connect back to each other like Central Pattern Generators (CPGs)
3. **Structured networks**: Specific patterns (e.g., columnar organization)

Recurrent connections can produce robust and variable rhythmic dynamics.

### Population Dynamics

In large networks, we often care about **population-level** properties:

- **Firing rates**: Average number of spikes per unit time
- **Synchrony**: How coordinated is the activity?
- **Oscillations**: Rhythmic patterns of activity
- **Frequency responses**: How does the network respond to inputs at different frequencies?

## Key Principles for Modeling

Computational models help interpret experimental findings:

1. **Forward problem**: Given a model, predict what measurements should look like
2. **Inverse problem**: Given measurements, infer underlying neural properties
3. **Parameter estimation**: Fit model parameters to match data
4. **Hypothesis testing**: Use models to generate testable predictions

## The Modeling Cycle

1. **Formulate** a hypothesis about neural function
2. **Build** a computational model
3. **Simulate** and analyze model behavior
4. **Compare** with experimental data
5. **Refine** the model and repeat
